# csv2lflist
A simple tool to turn your .csv collections (from YGOProDeck) into .lflist files compatible with EDOPro (for banlists)!
Available in .py form (if you want to take a look at the source code, make some changes, etc.) or .exe file if you just wanna get buildin' decks for your Progression Series!


### How does it work?

1. (.py file only) Have tkinter installed, it's needed for compiling.
2. Execute the .py file with `py path/to/file/csv2lflist.py` on your command line.
3. When prompted, look for your .csv file in the file explorer.
4. A .lflist.config file will appear wherever you saved the csv2lflist.py file in your system, you can move it to EDOPro's "lflist" folder.


### Future changes:
- Maybe a more easily read UI?
- Allowing changes to banlist in-app for personalization!
- (feel free to give me any more suggestions!)
